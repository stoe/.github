5. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- Extra ‚ú® sparkles if you write a [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/specification) commit message.<br/>
  Example: "üêõ Fix `onClick` event handler", ":bug: Fix `onClick` event handler"
  - **intention**: The intention you want to express with the commit, using an emoji from the [list](https://gitmoji.dev/). Either in the :shortcode: or unicode format.
  - **message**: A brief explanation of the change.


[Draft pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocking you.

- Create a branch with a name that identifies the user and nature of the changes (similar to `user/branch-purpose`)
- Open a pull request and request a review from the [CODEOWNERS][CODEOWNERS]
